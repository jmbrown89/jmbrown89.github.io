This is my first blog post... ever! I have never really been one for blogging, but as I embark on a new journey I feel it will be useful to put my thoughts down and share them with colleagues, collaborators and students. I am very excited and honoured to join the Laboratory of Vision Engineering (LoVE) at the University of Lincoln. I am very grateful for the opportunity to work here, to teach the next generation of computer scientists, and start developing my own research ideas. It is early days yet (I've not even finished my mandatory training...) but I am very keen to get going! I have already met some wonderful people, and look forward to establishing some new projects, collaborations and friendships.

I first visited the university in 2015 when I attended the annual conference on Medical Image Understanding and Analysis (MIUA). The conference was particuarly memorable for me as I was finalising my PhD thesis at the time, and I got the chance to meet two very important people; Tim Cootes (keynote speaker, and the brains behind the "active shape model" on which my thesis was based) and Bill Crum (image registration guru and my external examiner!). I also got the chance to learn about the fantastic work going on in LoVE on proton therapy and imaging.

I was very taken by the city during my visit, and longed to return to explore the area further (and eat more Lincolnshire sausages). I visted again later that year as a tourist, and fell in love with the architecture, cobbled streets, tea rooms and pubs. I fondly remember walking up Steep Hill and standing awestruck in the shadow of the wonderful Lincoln Cathedral. Having now moved to Lincoln, I consider myself very lucky to live in such a vibrant, historical and flourishing city.

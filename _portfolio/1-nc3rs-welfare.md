This project is an NC3Rs-funded PhD studentship focused on the development of machine learning algorithms and open-source softare to automatically assess and monitor the welfare of animals used in biomedical research. The technology will be implemented "cage side" so that welfare can be assessed from video footage without disruption to the animals, and to minimise the need for human intervention.

The module introduces the concepts of Algorithms and Complexity, providing an understanding of therange of applications where algorithmic solutions are required. Students will be introduced to theanalysis of time and space efficiency of algorithms; to the key issues in algorithm design; to the rangeof techniques used in the design of various types of algorithms. Students will be introduced torelevant theoretical concepts around algorithms and complexity in the lectures, together with apractical experience of implementing a range of algorithms in the workshops.

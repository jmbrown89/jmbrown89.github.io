This module aims to provide a broad introduction to the field of image processing, culminating in a practical understanding of how to apply and combine techniques to various image-related applications. The students will be able to extract useful information from the raw image and interpret the image data. The techniques will be implemented using the mathematical programming language Matlab or OpenCV.

James is a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science (Imaging/Vision) at the University of Lincoln, UK. He received his bachelor's degree in computer science from the University of Birmingham in 2010, and went on to pursue his master's and PhD degrees with the Physical Sciences of Imaging in the Biomedical Sciences (PSIBS, now [Sci-Phy](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/sci-phy/index.aspx)) Centre for Doctoral Training. From 2014 to 2017 he held a postdoctoral position at MRC Harwell Institute; a founding member of the [International Mouse Phenoyping Consortium](http://www.mousephenotype.org/). For the next two years he held joint research fellow positions at the [Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) at Massachusetts General Hospital, and Harvard Medical School.

James' interests are primarily in the development of statistical and machine learning models for clinical decision support and understanding how genes affect different bodily systems. His work spans a number of areas including micro-CT imaging of mouse models (inflammatory arthritis, embryonic development), fundus photography of the infant retina (retinopathy of prematurity, or ROP), and multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging of white matter lesions (glioblastoma, stroke).
